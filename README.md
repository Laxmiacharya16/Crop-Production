# Crop-Production

## Project Overview

This project analyzes crop production in India using historical data. It predicts future crop yields, helping farmers and policymakers make better decisions.

## What's Included

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Filled missing values.
  - Converted categorical data into numbers using One-Hot Encoding.
  - Scaled numerical data for consistency.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualized crop production across states and seasons.
  - Analyzed trends in crop production over the years.

- **Model Building:**
  - Created and compared different machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict crop production.
  - Fine-tuned models to improve accuracy.

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Evaluated models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
  - Selected the best model for deployment.

- **Deployment:**
  - Developed a simple Streamlit app where users can input data and get predictions.
